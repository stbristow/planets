The two moons, Demos and Phobos, may be an issue for any visitng wearwolf-esque beasts. Would they ever revert back to their human forms? How will we make coffee on mars. All hope is lost. 
Apparently, a mummy is planning on joining up... he may appreciate the low humidity?  
A MISTAKe WAS MADE ON THIS LINE.
